web app built with react

## caution

“always use interface for public API’s definition when authoring a library or 3rd-party ambient type definitions.”

“consider using type for your React Component Props and State, because it is more constrained.”

## `state` might be undefined

use `obj?.prop`

## Redux

Redux is a pattern and library for managing and updating application state, using events called "actions". It serves as a centralized store for state that needs to be used across your entire application, with rules ensuring that the state can only be updated in a predictable fashion.

### redux app data flow

- Initial setup:
  - A Redux store is created using a root reducer function
  - The store calls the root reducer once, and saves the return value as its initial `state`
  - When the UI is first rendered, UI components access the current state of the Redux store, and use that data to decide what to render. They also subscribe to any future store updates so they can know if the state has changed.
- Updates:
  - Something happens in the app, such as a user clicking a button
  - The app code dispatches an action to the Redux store, like `dispatch({type: 'counter/incremented'})`
  - The store runs the reducer function again with the previous `state` and the current `action`, and saves the return value as the new `state`
  - The store notifies all parts of the UI that are subscribed that the store has been updated
  - Each UI component that needs data from the store checks to see if the parts of the state they need have changed.
  - Each component that sees its data has changed forces a re-render with the new data, so it can update what's shown on the screen
